# Architecture Decision Record: Real-time Collaborative Notes System

## Status

Proposed

## Date

2024-10-28

## Context

We are building a notes application that requires:

1. Real-time collaborative editing capabilities
2. Automatic saving of changes
3. Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
4. Scalability to handle multiple users and notes
5. Responsive UI that remains performant with large datasets

The system needs to handle scenarios where:

- Multiple users edit the same note simultaneously
- Network connectivity is unstable
- Users make rapid changes to notes
- The application needs to scale to handle thousands of notes and users

## Decision

We have decided to implement the following architecture:

### 1. State Management

- **Local State in Modal**: Each note editing modal maintains its own local state
- **Optimistic Updates**: Changes are reflected immediately in UI
- **Debounced Synchronization**: Changes are synchronized with a 1-second debounce
- **Version Control**: Each note maintains a version number for conflict detection

### 2. Real-time Communication

- **WebSocket Protocol**: For bi-directional real-time communication
- **Event-Based Architecture**: Using pub/sub pattern for updates
- **Message Format**:
  ```typescript
  {
    type: 'update',
    payload: {
      noteId: string,
      changes: Partial<Note>,
      version: number
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. Data Structure

```typescript
type Note = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  lastModified: Date;
  version: number;
};
```

### 4. Component Architecture

- Dashboard (Parent)
  - NotesList (Read-only view)
  - NoteModal (Edit view with local state)

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Better User Experience**

   - Immediate feedback for user actions
   - No explicit save button needed
   - Real-time collaboration support

2. **Performance**

   - Reduced server load through debouncing
   - Minimal re-renders due to local state management
   - Efficient updates through WebSocket

3. **Scalability**
   - Independent note updates
   - Stateless server architecture possible
   - Easy to add more collaborative features

### Negative

1. **Complexity**

   - More complex state management
   - Need to handle conflict resolution
   - Additional network error handling required

2. **Network Dependencies**

   - Requires stable WebSocket connection
   - Need fallback mechanisms for offline mode
   - Potential for lost updates

3. **Development Overhead**
   - More testing scenarios required
   - Need to maintain WebSocket infrastructure
   - More complex deployment requirements

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. REST-based Polling

- **Rejected** due to:
  - Higher server load
  - Delayed updates
  - Poor real-time experience

### 2. Server-Side State Management

- **Rejected** due to:
  - Higher latency
  - More server resources required
  - Poor offline experience

### 3. Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)

- **Considered** for future implementation
- Benefits:
  - Better conflict resolution
  - Offline-first capability
- Drawbacks:
  - Higher implementation complexity
  - Larger learning curve

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Real-time Functionality

1. Implement WebSocket infrastructure
2. Add basic state management
3. Implement debounced updates

### Phase 2: Conflict Resolution

1. Add version control
2. Implement basic conflict detection
3. Add retry mechanisms

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. Offline support
2. Collaborative cursors
3. User presence indicators

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- React for UI components
- Lodash for utility functions
- WebSocket client implementation

### Backend

- WebSocket server implementation
- Database with version control support
- Scaling infrastructure for WebSocket connections

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. WebSocket connection stability
2. Update latency
3. Conflict frequency
4. User concurrent editing patterns

### Alerting

1. WebSocket disconnections
2. High conflict rates
3. Synchronization delays

## Future Considerations

### Potential Improvements

1. Implementation of CRDTs for better conflict resolution
2. Addition of operational transformation
3. Enhanced offline capabilities
4. Real-time cursors and selections
5. Collaborative comments and annotations

### Scaling Considerations

1. WebSocket connection pooling
2. Database sharding strategies
3. Caching layer implementation
4. Load balancing approach

## Additional Notes

- Regular review of WebSocket server performance needed
- Monitor client-side performance metrics
- Consider implementing feature flags for gradual rollout
- Plan for data migration strategies
